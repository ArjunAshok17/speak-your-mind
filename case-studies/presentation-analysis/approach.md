# Approach for Qualitative & Quantitative Studies
The approach we'll use for this case study is as follows:

0. Grouping: for every expression that's potentially returned by HUME, we should 
group them into more human-readable traits (i.e. Nervousness => lip biting, 
facial tics, hands on face, etc.)
    1. With each of these groups, we can better communicate with users and 
    generate responses for pointers (w/ the LLM) more accurately

1. Qualitative: watch 10 Ted Talks, 10 presentations from famous speakers, and 
10 other instances of influencers [or celebrities] and how they speak. For each 
speech, record whether the specific characteristic worked in or against their 
favor, and whether it was noticeably present or not
    1. At the end, observe patterns among speakers and write down what groups of 
    behaviors helped their presentation the best

2. Quantitative: using the data, we can create correlation matrices to observe 
what fields are similar, modify the groupings as necessary, and figure out what 
groups quantitatively are negatively impacting the performance of a speech, and 
which groups of features are positively impacting
    1. The idea is to put some numbers to the approach we take, even if the 
    numbers are based on some level of qualitative/survey data
